						"I had the pleasure of working with Jeff several times during Dev Bootcamp. In a nutshell - when you think of a "cowboy coder", Jeff is the complete opposite. He's humble, pragmatic and always willing to lend a hand. When it comes to learning new technology, Jeff is great at breaking things down and takes the time to ensure everybody gets it. He's a pleasure to work with, and would make an outstanding addition to any team."

					“We knew from the beginning that media-based technology would be one of the best ways to
					communicate our content.  Jeff’s  knowledge about what was currently possible and more
					importantly his curiosity about how we could experiment in the hopes of crafting an even better and
					more-meaningful experience for our visitors was a key motivator for our team.  In the end, the project’s
					mix of screen-based, full-body and theatrical media along with hybrid digital-electromechanical
					interactive experiences is a testament to Jeff’s rigor and belief in finding the best tool to deliver a
					particular message.”

					“Working with others in a cohesive manner is a strong asset of Jeff's. He has the ability to quickly establish and maintain excellent rapport with all levels of personnel within a company. Jeff has shown an ability to adapt to any assignment and has demonstrated a strong motivation toward self improvement which was demonstrated by his excellent performance in a wide range of design and development projects he was assigned to.”

					“I needed a knowledgeable and dependable individual to teach our Rhino class and was extremely fortunate in finding Jeff. Energetic, dependable and accountable, Jeff has been a positive addition to our faculty and contributor to our industrial design program. Jeff's professional strengths and pleasant manner regarding education was reflected in his class count, which increased during his tenure. Jeff is highly qualified, personable, articulate, focused and a great young man to work with.”

					"Jeff and I worked very closely for six months on a project with very diverse structural and scenic design needs. He provided seemingly endless revisions to meet a client's changing demands. He was able to value engineer the design on several structures to help stay within our budget. He slipped seamlessly between designing a giant 60 ft. shark and then curved, wooden kiosks. Jeff resourced new vendors and worked with them to provide us with a new type of material. During installation of the exhibit, Jeff managed a mural installation team, the installation of a video component and handled a big quality control issue we had with the graphics. The thing I liked best about Jeff is that I would (way too often) ask him to do painful design tasks and he would always say, 'I can do that.'"
